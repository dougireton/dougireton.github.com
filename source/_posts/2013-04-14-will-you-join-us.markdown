Ohai Chefs!

This week, the week before Chef Conf, I'd like to talk a bit about our team and our culture, and invite you to join us.

## tl;dr 
Here's our job posting for a spot on our [Infrastructure Engineering team][1], which I hope you'll read, but I also hope you'll read on to get a personal feel for our team and the huge cultural shift happening right now at Nordstrom.

I've been working at Nordstrom for five years, first on the Windows Server Engineering team, then on Nordstrom.com as a developer, then as a build engineer, and finally on the Infrastructure Engineering team as a developer, working with Chef everyday. Up until very recently, Nordstrom has run a pretty traditional IT shop, big, heavily-planned projects, a preference for expensive, complicated vendor tools (Oracle, CA, Microsoft, BMC, etc) and siloed teams. I hope you'll see in a minute that we are taking real steps to become more agile, embrace open source tools, and become more cross-disipline, but first, a story.

## Follow your heart

Three and a half years ago I had my normal performance review and, at the end of it my manager, Andrea, asked me about career goals/aspirations. I told her that I really wanted to be a developer. I had been playing around with Rails at home and really enjoyed it. Even though I was not qualified to be a "real" developer, she encouraged me to have coffee with Gina, one of the development managers for Nordstrom.com. Nordstrom has a very relational culture and "having coffee" is how you build important relatinoships. After having coffee with Gina, I had coffee with another dev manager, a project manager, and three other Nordstrom.com web developers. I'm sure they went easy on me and thankfully, I didn't have to write a linked list pseudo-code implemtation on the whiteboard since I don't even have a CS degree. After about six months of time where I wrapped up my Windows Server Engineering projects, and tried to read up on web development, I moved over to the Nordstrom.com dev team.

The dev team had been thinking about how to incorporate me into the team without too much disruption, and they paired me up with a mentor, an experienced dev who was very good at teaching and pointing me in the right direction. I also bought a couple of C# books and started reading like crazy. I felt way out of my depth when I was assigned my first feature, but Tim, my mentor outlined all the places in the code I'd need to make changes and patiently answered all my implmentation questions. I felt quite a sense of pride when my feature shipped four months later.

## Four months later?

Wait, four months later? One of the big frustrations we had was that actually deploying code to production web servers was so difficult. Features were bundled into big 4-5 month project releases and cross-team code merges were saved unti the end of the project, which caused all the problems you may imagine. After working on the dev team for five months, I had the opportunity to move to a newly forming team focused on fixing our build and deployment process. I'll gloss over my time as a build engineer, but out of it I got a better understanding of how complicated it is to deliver reliable and consistent builds to prod on a regular basis. Also in that time, the dev teams decided to move to a three-week cadence for prod deployments instead of 4-5 months which was a huge change.

## Chef and Infrastruture Engineering

During my tenure as a build engineer, we started to evaluate Chef.
