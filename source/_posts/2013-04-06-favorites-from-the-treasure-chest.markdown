Ohai Chefs!

Work has been busy and I've been working on my [Chef Conf][1] presentation in my "free" time, so this week I'm rounding up some links I think you'll like.

[1]: http://chefconf.opscode.com/

1. [Last check-in time for nodes][2] by Josh Timberman. Nice short post with great explanations.

2. [How the Chef client builds the Resource Collection queue][3] by Eric Hollensbe. I have a much better understanding of how a Chef run actually works after reading this.

3. Good [overview of Chef testing][4] by Nathen Harvey.

4. Also see Joshua Timberman's [Anatomy of a Test Kitchen 1.0 Cookbook][5] for more testing goodness.

5. Chef Shell (a.k.a. Shef) [debugging tips][6] by Steven Danna. This is one blog post I really need to dig into when I have a free morning.

6. [Continuous Deployment at Etsy][7]. An excellent presentation by Ross Snyder at Etsy. Need to convince your boss that Continuous Delivery/Deployment is a good idea? This will help.

7. Jon Cowie from Etsy will reprise his Velocity 2012 talk [Michelin Starred Cooking with Chef][8] on May 14th, 2013. I attended this talk at Velocity last year and I'm looking forward to seeing it again. Highly recommended.

8. I was just going to have seven links but I couldn't help add this one in. Josh Timberman's Big Ruby Conf talk on [5 Things You Didn't Know About Chef][9].
