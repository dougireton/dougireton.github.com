This past week, I went to [Velocity][1] and [DevOps Days][2] in Silicon Valley, CA. Both
conferences were amazing and I learned a ton. During DevOps Days I led an [Open
Space][3] session on "Encouraging Women in Dev/Ops". I was humbled by the number
of people who attended and their passion for the topic. Read on for a summary of
my notes taken during the hour we had.

1. Women will apply for job when they meet 100% of criteria, men 60%
I suspect this is because women are taught not to be boastful as girls, while
boys are taught to "go for it". Not sure if there's science to back up this
claim.

2. Hiring managers networks contain too few women, so expand those networks
Austin: Girls Hack, provides bonding place for women in tech
Other cities have women's tech meetups. For example, here's a [good listing in
Seattle][4]

3. Benefits: Longer maternity and flex hours are better for women candidates,
   job share Foosball table is not necessarily a selling point. Be careful not
to create a "dude's" environment at work

4. As a manager treat everyone as an individual. Be careful not to treat women
   on your team as "one of the guys", but also not like a "fragile flower".

5. We praise women for appearance and kindness; men praised for accomplishments, so
praise women for accomplishments. This is an awareness thing and takes practice.

6. "Feels great to not be the only woman on team, very empowering". This quote
   really struck me. Of course it's better to have one woman on your team than
none, but in order for the woman to not feel like the token woman on the team
it's better to have two or more.

7. Need women on DevOps Days Organizaing team. The DevOps Days organizers really
would like women to participate in planning future DevOps Days events. Email
[info@devopsdays.org][5] for more information.
